# Twilight Highlands Helper

Twilight Highlands Helper is a simple companion for the Midnight pre‑patch event. It keeps you focused on the next rare in the Twilight’s Blade rotation so you can stay in the hunt instead of checking notes or timers.

## What it feels like in game
- You fly into Twilight Highlands and immediately get a clear marker for the next rare in the rotation.
- When you kill that rare, the addon automatically points you to the next one.
- It’s a steady “go here next” guide that’s perfect for farming the **Two Minutes to Midnight** achievement or just catching every spawn.

## Why you’d use it
- You don’t want to memorize the rotation.
- You want a clean, always‑up‑to‑date target without bouncing between guides.
- You’re chaining rares with friends and want everyone moving together.

If you’re spending time in Twilight Highlands during the event, this addon keeps the hunt smooth and focused.
