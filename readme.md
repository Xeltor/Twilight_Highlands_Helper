# Twilight Highlands Helper

**Twilight Highlands Helper** is a lightweight waypoint companion for *Midnight*’s **Twilight Ascension** pre-patch event. Twilight’s Blade rares cycle on a regular **10-minute summoning rotation**, and this addon’s whole job is simple: **after you kill one, it points you to the next one**—so your group keeps moving without checking notes, guides, or timers.

## What it does

* Drops a **TomTom waypoint** (if you have TomTom) **or** uses the **built-in map pin system**
* When an event rare dies, it **automatically advances** and sets your marker to the **next rare location** in the rotation
* Nothing else: **no timers, no alerts, no loot lists, no big UI**—just “go here next”

## Why it’s useful in Twilight Ascension

Twilight Ascension rares are part of a repeatable ritual loop in Twilight Highlands, and **Two Minutes to Midnight** asks you to defeat all of the Twilight’s Blade summons—so staying on the rotation matters. This addon keeps the rare train smooth, especially when you’re chaining kills with friends.
